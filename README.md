## Hi there, I'm Jian ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software engineer based in Italy, **ReactJS and AWS enthusiast**, I love spending my time to learn new technologies and creating things, you see, the process of creating something even if it is just a little project makes me very excited and happy.

### What I'm doing ðŸ”¥

- `level up JS and AWS skill` doing side project, the latest progress below
- `studying by myself Japanese and Chinese`, little progress every day

### What's coming ðŸ˜Ž

- `brand new personal website` before the end this year, ya I know [currently](https://zhoujian.now.sh) is really old and ugly
