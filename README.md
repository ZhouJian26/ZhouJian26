### Hi there, I'm Jian ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software engineer based in Italy, **ReactJS, Typescript, Kubernetes and AWS enthusiast**, I love spending my time to learn new technologies and creating things, you see, the process of creating something even if it is just a little project makes me very excited and happy.

### My little milestones ðŸš€

- `Sumy` the app for keeping track of sums (*Beta*). [Try it now](https://sumy.heyma.io)
  - it is a project composed of 2 parts, the frontend is developed with NextJS while the backend is a Express server using OpenAPI for schema validation and documentation
  - it uses **AWS DynamoDB** as data storage
  - the stack is deployed on a **multi-regional kubernetes** cluster
  - the **entire process of CICD is managed on a kubernetes cluster** using **Gitlab** as version control, **Jenkins** to build the docker images, **Harbor** as docker and helm registry, **ArgoCD** to deploy and manage the application infrastructure
  - the application infrastructure is described with a helm chart
  > I learned how to create from scratch a kubernetes cluster (homelab), manage stateful applications by configuring a distributed storage with rook/cephfs and manage end-to-end flow of a project developed entirely on kubernetes
- generate random name with `Nawes`. [Try it now](https://nawes.heyma.io)
  - it is a static website hosted on **AWS S3 through AWS Cloudflare**. The CICD is managed by **AWS CodeBuild**.
  - the package is update automatically through **github actions** that **build and publish it to NPM registry on specific git events**
  > I learned how to **manage and publish an NPM package** and finally use it in a project
- a `brand new personal website` before the end this year, ya I know the [current one](https://zhoujian.now.sh) is really old and ugly
  > I learned how to create a simple website with NextJS and deploy it in the cloud (Vercel)

### What's next ðŸ”¥
- `Guardiano` is the current greatest challenge, the ambition is to create an algorithm capable of managing the ACL as they should be. Something that can go beyond the current state of the art.
